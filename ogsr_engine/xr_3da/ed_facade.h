// ed_facade.h — Editor-host facade (architecture a2: monolith-as-loadable-module).
//
// The SDK level editor loads xrEngine_VK.dll (built with EdDllBuild=true) and drives
// the engine's Vulkan renderer through these C-ABI entry points, instead of its own
// DX9 ECore device. The whole engine+renderer+game monolith stays intact behind this
// narrow facade — see the "editor-renderer-unification" design.
//
// A2.1: Ed_Ping — DLL-load / GetProcAddress liveness probe.
// A2.2: Ed_Init/Ed_RenderFrame/Ed_Shutdown — boot the engine WITHOUT its message loop
//       so an external host drives frames.
// A2.3: Ed_InitEx — render into a HOST-OWNED window (the SDK's viewport panel) instead
//       of the engine's own top-level window.

//
// This exists because Ed_AddModel's name lookup structurally cannot resolve an editor

// never the individual static props a level source is made of (measured: 0 of Cordon's 434
// visuals resolve). The host owns those as source .object files and exports each to a real

// (the child window it created), while the host's projection describes the host's whole
// window, so the two disagree by exactly the viewport inset and any DLSS render-vs-display

// the host's own ImGuizmo renders onto its DX9 surface, which is underneath this
// renderer's window and therefore invisible, and its rect covers the host's whole window
// rather than the inset viewport.

// 2 scale; mode: 0 local, 1 world; snap: null for none), then read Ed_GizmoResult, which
