// xrRenderVulkan — TESSENDORF FFT OCEAN: constants and complex arithmetic shared
// by the four compute stages (h0 → spectrum → FFT → assemble).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, given there is already a nine-octave analytic swell in
// water_common.glsl: that swell is a sum of `exp(sin())` lobes displaced along Y
// only. A sum of vertically-displaced sines cannot produce a SHARP CREST — the
// peak of a sine is round by construction, and no amount of octaves changes it.
// Real wind waves are sharp on top and flat in the trough because the water at
// the crest is also displaced HORIZONTALLY, inward from both sides. That is the
// whole of Tessendorf's "choppy wave" term, it needs the field in the Fourier
// domain to compute, and it is the single thing the analytic model cannot fake.
//
// The spectrum is Phillips (Tessendorf 1999, "Simulating Ocean Water"); the same
// mathematics as the reference project this was modelled on
// (github.com/kentril0/WaterSurfaceRendering, MIT). That project computes its FFT
// on the CPU with FFTW3 + OpenMP and uploads the result every frame. Here it is
// all compute shaders: no third-party dependency, no per-frame upload, and no
// cost on the game thread.
