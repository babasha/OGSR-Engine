//
// A blended surface layer, NOT an opaque one. The bottom is already in the
// colour target when this runs (water is drawn after the whole opaque world +
// sky, writes no depth, and is excluded from the depth prepass), so the "see
// through the water" half of the picture costs nothing: it is the destination
// side of the blend. That is why there is no scene-colour copy here.
//
// Composite, with PREMULTIPLIED alpha (src = ONE, dst = ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA):
//
//   out.rgb = F·reflection + (1-F)·(1-T)·scatter + sun glitter
//   out.a   = 1 - T·(1-F)
//
// where F is the Fresnel reflectance of the surface and T = exp(-k·thickness)
// the Beer-Lambert transmittance of the water column the view ray crosses. The
// three energy terms sum to one: F reflected, (1-F)(1-T) scattered back out of
// the body, (1-F)T transmitted from the bottom — which is exactly what the
// blend leaves of the destination.
//
// Waves are an ANALYTIC slope field (no normal map): stock content ships no
// water normal texture, and an analytic sum gives exact derivatives, which is
// what the sun glitter needs in order to spread into a path instead of
// sparkling into per-pixel noise.
