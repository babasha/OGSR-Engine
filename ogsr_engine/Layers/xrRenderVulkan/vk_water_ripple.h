// xrRenderVulkan — INTERACTIVE WATER RIPPLES.
//
// A 2D wave-equation heightfield on a tile that follows the camera. This is the
// half of "water" that no amount of analytic wave functions can fake: a sum of
// sines does not propagate, does not reflect, does not interfere, and — the
// point — has nowhere for a footstep or a bullet to write. This field does.
//
// Ping-pong RG16F (r = height in metres, g = velocity), stepped once per frame
// by water_ripple.comp. The tile origin snaps to whole texels so scrolling is
// an exact integer shift with no resampling blur, and the border band absorbs
// so the moving window never rings off its own edge.
//
// Consumers: water.tese (displaces geometry by the height) and water.frag
// (shades by the slope) — both via waterRipple() in water_common.glsl.
//
// NOT to be confused with vk_water_sim.cpp (`r_water_*`), the parked shallow-
// water PUDDLE flow simulation — different equation, different purpose.

// Queue a disturbance for this frame's step (world XZ, radius in metres,
// strength in metres — negative dips, positive humps). Cheap and lossy: excess
// splats past the per-frame cap are dropped.
//
// `srcY` is the SOURCE's own height, checked against the water surface the step
// finds at that texel. Pass kNoHeightTest for sources that land on whatever is
// there (rain). It is not optional bookkeeping: without it a splat is a position
// in plan view, and level water sheets run unseen under banks and floors, so
// standing on dry ground a metre above one still rippled it.

// POOL MASK: the water surface height at every texel of the tile, or `dry` where
// there is no water at all. Without it the wave equation runs on one unbroken

//   .g = the ground in this column, or MaskDryValue() where the top-down height
//        map cannot answer for it (a hillside over a buried sheet, a ceiling)
// The mask pass owns it because it is the only pass that walks the water visuals,

// LOCAL FETCH (R32F, its own coarse grid over the same tile): metres of basin per
// column, 0 where there is no local answer. The wave machinery has always gated

// pool a couple of times over — but the number it was handed came from the
// bounding box of the water VISUAL, and level water is not one mesh per pool.
// Cordon is a single visual 79.8 x 148.2 m, so the two-metre circle of water
// inside a well in the village was told it sat in a 108 m basin: 37 cm of crest
// in 22 cm of water, over the stone ring, and a ring of yard that soaked and
// dried again with every wave. This map answers per column instead.
//
// ⭐ It can only ever say SMALLER. A column whose water reaches the search limit
// is written as 0, and 0 means "keep what the CPU pushed" — so open water is
// bit-identical to the old behaviour and the only thing this can do is take a
// wave away from a body too small to carry one.

// the map is sampled by the water DRAW, which runs even with the sim off, and the
// clear used to live inside Dispatch() behind that early-out — so the draw sampled an
// UNDEFINED image. Call before building the water descriptor set. Zero reads as "no
// local answer, keep the visual's own fetch", i.e. the pre-existing behaviour.
