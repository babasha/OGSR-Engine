// CPU-side colour-space conversion for the linear pipeline (r_linear_color).
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Textures get linearised for free by the sampler once they are loaded as _SRGB
// (see TexColorSpace in vk_texture.h). Everything that reaches the GPU as a
// CONSTANT does not: weather/env colours parsed from .ltx, dynamic light colours
// from item configs and ALife spawn data, particle colours from the effect
// definitions. Those are all authored by eye against a display, i.e. sRGB-encoded,
// so they must be decoded here or they become the one gamma-space term left in an
// otherwise linear light equation — which reads as "everything is too bright and
// washed out", the exact failure this whole arc started from.
//
// Deliberately a header of inlines rather than a .cpp: these sit in per-frame UBO
// fills (vk_env_light, vk_volumetrics, the grass/tree pushes) and the conversion
// must not cost a call. There are only a few dozen colours per frame, so the pow()
// is irrelevant next to being able to reason about where the conversion happened.
//
// SCOPE NOTE — what is deliberately NOT converted here:
//  * Scalars that merely look like colour channels (hemi_color.w is an "R2
//    correction" factor, ambient.w is a sky gate, GpuLight::color[3] is a
//    spot/point flag). Only .rgb is ever touched.
//  * Weather keyframe interpolation. CEnvDescriptorMixer::lerp blends the two
//    bracketing keyframes in gamma space and we convert AFTER it, on upload. That
//    keeps the artist-visible behaviour of a weather transition byte-identical to
//    what it has always been; linearising at parse time would silently change the
//    shape of every sunrise in the game.

// Intentionally depends on nothing but the core math types (Fvector*/Fcolor, via
// stdafx) and <cmath>. This header is pulled into TUs with delicate include order —
// vk_ParticleEffect / vk_gpu_particles_translate set up D3D-stub compat preambles
// before their real includes — so it must not drag in the Vulkan headers.
#include <cmath>
