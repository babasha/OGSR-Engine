// xrRenderVulkan — Sky specular IBL (image-based lighting) prefilter.
//
// The two weather sky cubes (env_s0/env_s1) ship BC-compressed and single-mip, so
// the forward shaders could only tap them at LOD 0 — no roughness blur, so glass /
// wet / "reflect the sky" looked like a sharp mirror at every roughness. This module
// resamples the BLENDED sky into an RGBA16F cube with a roughness-mip chain (mip N =
// rougher reflection) that the receivers sample with the split-sum specular IBL term
// (env_common.glsl iblSpecular). The sun's own GGX highlight rides the same F0/roughness.
//
// The prefilter is recorded into the FRAME's command buffer, on demand (only when the
// weather cube view changes or the cross-fade moves). v1 = straight resample + box-blit
// mips; the clean upgrade is per-mip GGX importance-sample convolution.
//
// ⚠⚠It used to run on the fence-waited IMMEDIATE queue, and "the sky changes rarely so
// there is no per-frame cost" was true of the GPU work and false of the cost. The submit
// went to the GRAPHICS queue and then blocked the main thread on its fence, so the CPU
// waited for the whole queue to drain — the entire frame's rendering — for a ~1 MB cube.
// Measured 01-08: 22-40 ms of CPU inside Pass_World, every few seconds, while the frame's
// own GPU zones read completely normal (the work was on a SEPARATE submit, so no zone
// could see it). That was the stutter users reported, and it fired while standing still
// because the trigger is the sky cross-fade, which advances on the game clock.
// See vk_env_light.cpp EnvLight::Update for the call site and the W/pro/env probe.

// from call sites that cannot promise that: the refresh is simply skipped and the probe
// keeps last frame's content, which for a <2%-per-refresh sky is invisible.

// skyRotation (rad) is the weather's sky_rotation — the SAME spin the dome draw
// applies. It is part of the probe's identity, not a cosmetic extra: without it
// the probe's azimuth drifts away from the visible sky, so it participates in the
// change detection like the cubes and the cross-fade do.
// groundBounce scales the below-horizon hemisphere during the SH projection (the
// sky cube's skirt is not sky radiance — see sky_sh_project.comp.glsl).

// refresh: if any of them moves, the probe is a different sky and must be rebuilt.
// This arc's recurring bug was exactly a field missing from here — first the
// half-cube remap, then sky_rotation, then sky_color — each time leaving the probe
// describing a sky the player was not looking at.
