// ImageState — per-image layout/stage/access tracker (the framegraph execute seam).
//
// The first brick of the render graph. Instead of every consumer hand-placing a
// flip-to-READ / flip-back-to-ATTACHMENT round-trip, it calls Require(the state
// it needs) and a barrier is emitted ONLY when the tracked state actually has to
// change. A RUN of consumers that all need the SAME state (SSAO, VRS, VSM-mark,
// VSM-resolve all sampling the prepass depth) coalesces to a single transition —
// killing the depth-thrash (4 round-trips -> 1). A later write correctly waits on
// the union of every intervening reader (stage/access are OR-accumulated on the
// read-after-read no-op). Generalizes to every scene resource and, once it carries
// a queue family, to cross-queue ownership for async compute.

// a tracker rather than 50 hand-placed calls.

// This is what the VSM bin / world-cull / tree-cull SSBO hand-offs actually
// need, and the async-compute split needs it BEFORE the images (the indirect
// buffers are what crosses the queue boundary first).
